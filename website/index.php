        <p id="homePagep" >CAMP, or Cornell Association of Medicine and Philanthropy, is a STEM/
           Pre- health focused organization on campus.  Our purpose is to
           broaden perspectives on areas of medical work other than a single
           pre-medical purpose as well as to raise awareness and give back
           through philanthropic events to underrepresented causes.
           We admit all students who demonstrate a genuine interest in the
           organization with our purpose and support and encourage all STEM
            studentsâ€™ interests.
